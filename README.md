# From Code to Conclusions

A structured, practice-driven Python learning repository designed to take learners from fundamental programming concepts to applied data analysis and visualisation using the Python data stack.

This repository follows a pedagogical progression from basic syntax and control structures to working with NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames, and generating analytical insights through data visualisation.

It is intended to serve as:
- a revision resource for foundational Python concepts
- a guided learning track for beginners
- a practice environment for transitioning into data analysis workflows


---

## Learning Objectives

By working through the notebooks in this repository, a learner should be able to:

- Understand Python syntax and data types
- Implement control flow using conditionals and loops
- Work with Python data structures such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- Write reusable functions and use lambda expressions
- Apply list and dictionary comprehensions
- Perform numerical computations using NumPy
- Manipulate tabular datasets using Pandas
- Handle missing values and perform group-wise aggregations
- Create visualisations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis on structured datasets
